I used following tech :-
Front-End:- Htm, Css, Js
Back-End:- Node, Express
Database:- MongoDB

Major Features:-
1) Creation of employees account.
2) Seperate dashboards for admin and employe
3) Admin can sort data w.r.t. date and employee name. Admin can also select the date range to view or print data.
4) Direct print action button for seamless data printing on paper, for records.
5) Employee has text fields to insert data like, "Date, Party Code, Medical Name, City, Receipt No., Amount, Remarks"

3) Delete option for employee incase they make the wrong entry.
